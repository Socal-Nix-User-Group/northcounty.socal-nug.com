Come join us for the first North County NUG meetup! Bring your laptop, show off your Nix configs, and ask questions.
No prior experience with Nix is required, and all are welcome.

This is the first outdoor SNUG! While we don't currently expect presentations,
come to meet other San Diego area NixOS users. The Camp Store has beer on tap,
pizza, wings, and more. We'll have a power inverter and internet connectivity
taken care of.

Parking is fairly limited directly next to the Camp Store (only around 9 spots),
but there is free parking on Ponto Road and Avenida Encinitas. See [Location](https://thecampstore.com/location/) for more info.
