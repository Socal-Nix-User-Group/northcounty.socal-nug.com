Come join us for the first North County NUG meetup! Bring your laptop, show off your Nix configs, and ask questions.
No prior experience with Nix is required, and all are welcome.

This is the first outdoor SNUG! While we don't currently expect presentations,
come to meet other San Diego area NixOS users and enjoy the sunset.

### Location

![](../../assets/campstore/cs-sunset.jpg)

The Camp Store has beer on tap, pizza, wings, and more. We'll have a power
inverter and internet connectivity taken care of.

We have Patio Table #1 reserved for NCN #1. Depending on turnout,
we may get another next time. See the diagram below:

### Driving

Parking is fairly limited directly next to the Camp Store (only around 9 spots),
but there is free parking on Ponto Road and Avenida Encinas. See [Location](https://thecampstore.com/location/) for more info.
